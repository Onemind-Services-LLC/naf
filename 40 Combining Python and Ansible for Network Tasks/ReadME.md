Objective: Demonstrate how Python and Ansible can be integrated for more complex and efficient network automation tasks. Tasks: 

    Python and Ansible Integration: Guide on using Python to generate dynamic inventory for Ansible. 

    Advanced Network Playbooks: Develop Ansible playbooks that are triggered from Python scripts based on certain conditions or events. 

    Custom Modules: Create custom Ansible modules with Python for tasks that require specific logic not available in existing modules. 

    Real-World Scenarios: Scripting complex network operations combining both Python and Ansible.


1. Dynamic Inventory
2. Custom Python modules
3. Filter plugins
4. Ansible playbook that uses custom modules and filter plugin created above to achieve a network automation related complex task
