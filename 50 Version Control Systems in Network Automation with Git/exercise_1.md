# Git Installation and Setup

## Installing Git on Linux:

1. **Update Package Lists:** Open a terminal and update the package lists of your Linux distribution using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Git:** Use the package manager to install Git. For Ubuntu/Debian based systems, you can do this with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git
   ```
   For other distributions, the command might be different (e.g., yum for CentOS, dnf for Fedora).

3. **Verify Installation:** After installation, verify that Git has been installed successfully by running:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Git version.

## Installing Git on Windows:

1. **Download Git Installer:** Go to the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and download the Git installer for Windows.

2. **Run Installer:** Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation wizard steps.
   - Choose installation options as per your preference (e.g., adjusting PATH environment, choosing editor, etc.).
   - Use default settings if you're unsure.

3. **Complete Installation:** Once the installation is complete, Git should be ready to use.
