Lab 1: Basic Automation with Python 

Objective: Introduce basic programming concepts using Python and demonstrate how to automate simple network tasks. Tasks: 

    Setup Python Environment: Guide on setting up Python on different operating systems and using virtual environments. 

    Python Basics: Cover variables, data types, control structures, functions, and modules. 

    Network Scripting: Write scripts to ping devices, retrieve device status, and parse command outputs. 

    Automating Device Configuration: Script to log into devices and change configurations using Netmiko or similar libraries. 


Lab 2: Introduction to Ansible for Network Configuration 

Objective: Teach the fundamentals of Ansible and its use in automating network device configurations. Tasks: 

    Ansible Setup: Installation and configuration of Ansible on a control machine. 

    Understanding Playbooks: Basics of writing Ansible playbooks including inventory, tasks, handlers, and variables. 

    Managing Network Configurations: Create playbooks to configure network devices, handle configuration backups, and apply security settings. 

    Error Handling and Reporting: Implement error checking and generate reports on playbook execution results. 


Lab 3: Combining Python and Ansible for Network Tasks 

Objective: Demonstrate how Python and Ansible can be integrated for more complex and efficient network automation tasks. Tasks: 

    Python and Ansible Integration: Guide on using Python to generate dynamic inventory for Ansible. 

    Advanced Network Playbooks: Develop Ansible playbooks that are triggered from Python scripts based on certain conditions or events. 

    Custom Modules: Create custom Ansible modules with Python for tasks that require specific logic not available in existing modules. 

    Real-World Scenarios: Scripting complex network operations combining both Python and Ansible.
