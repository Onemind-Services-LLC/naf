Here are some examples of Python and Cisco IOS STIG tests:
Test that the banner message is configured correctly.
This can be done by using the show banner command to check the current banner message and then comparing it to the required banner message.
Test that the logging level is set to the required level.
This can be done by using the show logging command to check the current logging level and then comparing it to the required logging level.
Test that the password complexity requirements are met.
This can be done by using the show password command to check the current password complexity requirements and then comparing them to the required password complexity requirements.
Test that the unused services are disabled.
This can be done by using the show running-config command to check the current configuration and then looking for any unused services that are enabled.
Test that the required patches are installed.
This can be done by using the show version command to check the current version of Cisco IOS and then comparing it to the required version.
These are just a few examples of Python and Cisco IOS STIG tests. There are many other tests that can be written, and the best approach will vary depending on the specific needs of the user.
Here is an example of a Python script that can be used to test the banner message:


import subprocess

def test_banner_message():
  """Tests the banner message.

  Returns:
    True if the banner message is configured correctly, False otherwise.
  """

  command = ["show banner"]
  output = subprocess.check_output(command)

  if "This is a secure system." in output:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Example usage:

if test_banner_message():
  print("The banner message is configured correctly.")
else:
  print("The banner message is not configured correctly.")
